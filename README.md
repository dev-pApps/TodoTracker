# Todo Tracker : Privacy policy
Welcome to the Todo Tracker app for Android.

# Data collected by the app.
I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I did not design this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (your list of tasks) set by you (the user) is stored locally on your device and can be easily removed by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. There is no analytics software in the app, either. It is a very simple app with no hidden data collected, designed to manage your day to day goals.

If you discover a security vulnerability that was mistakenly introduced by me, or if you have any questions about how the app protects your privacy, please shoot me an email or start a conversation on GitHub, and I will gladly attempt to fix it/help.

Yours sincerely,
